#INSTAGRAM-CLIENT#

##Demo##

###To run###

    npm install
    npm start

###To create dist package###

    npm run dist

    
###Noteworthy###

 - Instagram doesn't support getting any random data, so I needed to hardcode tags
 - Instagram doesn't support NO-CORS requests, so I had to use proxy - **YQL**
